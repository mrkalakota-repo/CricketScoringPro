# Gully Cricket Scorer — CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview
Cross-platform cricket scoring app (Android + iOS + mobile web) — React Native + Expo SDK 54.
Supports T20/ODI/Test/custom formats, team/player management, ball-by-ball scoring with undo,
proximity-based team discovery, leagues, real-time player chat, and delegate team access.

## Commands

```bash
npm start              # Expo dev server — start Metro with correct local IP:
                       # REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME=<mac-ip> npx expo start --port 8081
npm run android        # Android emulator
npm run ios            # iOS simulator
npm run web            # Mobile web (http://localhost:8081)
npm test               # Jest unit tests (engine only)
npm test -- --testPathPattern=functional          # Run a single test file by name
npm test -- --testNamePattern="strike rotation"   # Run tests matching a name pattern
npx expo install <pkg> # Add Expo package (add --legacy-peer-deps if it fails)
```

## Architecture

### Platform-Specific Files
Metro resolves `.web.ts` over `.ts` on web. Every DB repo needs both files:
- `team-repo.ts` / `team-repo.web.ts`
- `match-repo.ts` / `match-repo.web.ts`
- `prefs-repo.ts` / `prefs-repo.web.ts`
- `league-repo.ts` / `league-repo.web.ts`

Cloud repos (`cloud-team-repo`, `cloud-chat-repo`, `cloud-delegate-repo`, `cloud-match-repo`, `cloud-league-repo`, `cloud-user-repo`) use Supabase — same on all platforms, no `.web.ts` needed.

### Scoring Engine
`src/engine/` — pure TypeScript, zero React/RN dependencies. Never import React or RN APIs there.

`MatchEngine` is **immutable** — every method returns a new `MatchEngine` instance. Never mutate the existing instance; always replace it:
```ts
const newEngine = engine.recordBall(input);   // ✓ returns new instance
set({ engine: newEngine });
engine.recordBall(input);                      // ✗ wrong — return value ignored
```
Test files live in `src/engine/__tests__/` (`match-engine.test.ts` — unit tests; `functional.test.ts` — end-to-end scenarios).

### Store Pattern
All mutations go through Zustand stores, never directly through repos.
- `useTeamStore` — team/player CRUD; `loadTeams` also does cloud ownership sync (60 s cooldown per phone)
- `useMatchStore` — match lifecycle, scoring engine, undo, auto-save after every ball
- `usePrefsStore` — device-local prefs: `myTeamIds` (owned), `playerTeamIds` (player-member, view-only), `delegateTeamIds`
- `useLeagueStore` — leagues and fixtures; syncs to/from Supabase `cloud_leagues`/`cloud_league_fixtures` when the user is authenticated (owner-scoped by phone). `loadLeagues` fetches from cloud and upserts locally on every call.
- `useChatStore` — real-time per-team chat
- `useLiveScoresStore` — nearby live match scores (Supabase real-time, 50-mile radius)
- `useAdminAuth` — in-memory PIN auth (resets on restart by design)
- `useUserAuth` — global user auth (phone + PIN); session in-memory, profile persisted locally + Supabase

### User Auth & RBAC
`src/hooks/useUserAuth.ts` — Zustand store for global auth (phone-number registration + PIN). Profile is saved locally (`user_prefs`) and pushed to Supabase `user_profiles` for cross-device restore.

Key behaviours:
- `login()` re-pushes the profile to Supabase on every successful local sign-in, recovering profiles whose initial push was dropped (e.g. table didn't exist at registration time).
- `updateProfile(name, newPin?)` — updates name and/or PIN locally + cloud; used by `app/my-profile.tsx` (the logged-in user's own profile screen, with name edit, PIN change, and sign-out).
- `sessionExpired: boolean` — set when web `sessionStorage` is missing the PIN hash (tab closed and reopened). UI auto-switches to the restore form with phone pre-filled; local login is impossible in this state.
- `restoreErrorMessage` — propagated from `verifyUserProfile` RPC so the UI can show actionable errors.
- `verifyUserProfile` in `cloud-user-repo.ts` auto-retries up to 3× with a 2.5 s delay on Supabase schema-cache cold-start errors (`PGRST205` / "schema cache" phrase) before returning a friendly "Server is waking up" message.

**Phone format:** US-only 10-digit input with a `+1` affix. Strip non-digits and validate `length === 10` before any auth call. Stored as bare 10 digits (no country code) in both local prefs and Supabase.

`src/hooks/useRole.ts` — pure function of `profile.role`; returns `RolePermissions` object. Use this for all gate checks; never inspect `profile.role` directly in UI.

Roles and permissions matrix:

| Permission | league_admin | team_admin | scorer | viewer |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Create League | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Manage Teams | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Create/Start Match | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Record Balls (Score) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Delete Match | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| View Live Scores | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

Available roles at registration: `scorer`, `team_admin`, `league_admin` — **viewer is not offered**. Unauthenticated users browse as guests with viewer-equivalent read-only access. `useRole()` returns all-false + `role: null` when not authenticated.

### Sync Status
`src/hooks/useSyncStatus.ts` — subscribes to cloud match repo sync events. States: `synced` | `syncing` | `offline` | `disabled`. Used for the scoring-screen cloud indicator.

## Key Design Decisions

### Bowling Rules (Enforced in Engine)
`MatchEngine.setBowler()` throws — not warns — on two violations:
1. **Consecutive overs**: same bowler cannot bowl back-to-back overs.
2. **Max overs per bowler (LOI)**: `Math.floor(oversPerInnings / 5)` — T20: 4, ODI: 10, custom: proportional. Test (`oversPerInnings === null`): unlimited.

The scoring UI greys out ineligible bowlers with a reason label: `(bowled last over)` or `(max N overs)`.

When writing test helpers that bowl multiple overs, use a **pool of ≥5 bowlers** and pick the eligible one with the fewest overs (not round-robin) to avoid quota exhaustion.

### Admin PIN
- SHA-256 hashed via expo-crypto; `adminPinHash: null` = open access
- Auth state is in-memory only — lost on restart intentionally
- Team creator auto-authenticated after creation

### Access Control (Team Edit)
- `isMyTeam` — team owned by this account (stored in `myTeamIds` pref; sourced from `cloud_teams.owner_phone`)
- `isPlayerTeam` — user is listed as a player on the team (`cloud_players.phone_number`); stored in `playerTeamIds` pref; shown in "My Teams" section with a **PLAYER** badge but gives no edit access
- `isDelegate` — granted editor access via 6-char delegate code; stored in `delegateTeamIds`
- `hasEditAccess = isMyTeam || isDelegate`
- Owners with a PIN must unlock (`adminUnlocked`) to reach roster/edit; no-PIN owners go straight through

### Delegate Codes
- Owner generates 6-char code (10 min TTL) stored in Supabase `delegate_codes`
- Other device enters code → verified + deleted (single-use) → `delegateTeamIds` stored locally
- Requires `isCloudEnabled` (real Supabase credentials in `.env`)

### Match ID
`matchRepo.createMatch()` takes a client-generated UUID — never let the repo generate its own ID.

### My Teams
Call `addMyTeam(teamId)` after every `createTeam()`. Stored in `user_prefs`.

### Proximity (Teams Tab)
Haversine, 50-mile radius. "My Teams" section shows owned + player-member teams. Up to 10 nearby others in a separate section; rest search-only.

`importCloudTeams` **purges** any locally-stored transient team (not in `myTeamIds`/`playerTeamIds`/`delegateTeamIds`) that is absent from the incoming cloud batch before upserting — this prevents duplicate rows accumulating after seed re-runs that generate new UUIDs.

### SQLite Initialization (Critical)
`PRAGMA` statements must be separate `execAsync` calls — Android SQLite skips subsequent
statements in a multi-statement block when the first statement returns a result row.
```ts
await db.execAsync('PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;');
await db.execAsync('PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;');
await db.execAsync('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ...');
```

### Expo Go on Device
Metro must advertise the Mac's real LAN IP (not 127.0.0.1):
```bash
REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME=<mac-ip> npx expo start --port 8081
```

## UI Conventions

### Colors — MD3 theme tokens only
Never hardcode `#1A1A1A`, `#666`, `#999` etc.
- Main text → `theme.colors.onSurface`
- Secondary → `theme.colors.onSurfaceVariant`
- Borders → `theme.colors.outlineVariant`
- Tinted bg → `theme.colors.surfaceVariant`
- Container bg → `theme.colors.primaryContainer`
- Text on container → `theme.colors.onPrimaryContainer`
- Text on primary header → `#FFFFFF` (always white)

### Dialogs — `<Portal><Dialog>` always
`Alert.alert` with multiple buttons does not work on mobile web.

### Error Handling
Wrap async in try/catch. Show errors inline (not Alert). Never silently swallow — at minimum `console.error()`.

## Theming
`src/theme/colors.ts` — palette | `src/theme/index.ts` — `lightTheme` / `darkTheme`

Primary: `#1B6B28` (green) · Secondary: `#E65100` (orange) · Light bg: `#EAF7EB` · Dark bg: `#091409`

---

## Player Skill Icons (MaterialCommunityIcons)

| Style | Icon | Color |
|---|---|---|
| Right-hand bat | `alpha-r-circle` | `#1B6B28` |
| Left-hand bat | `alpha-l-circle` | `#E65100` |
| Fast bowling | `lightning-bolt` | `#E65100` |
| Medium bowling | `weather-windy` | `#1565C0` |
| Off-break / Orthodox | `rotate-right` | `#6A1B9A` |
| Leg-break / Chinaman | `rotate-left` | `#00695C` |
| Does not bowl | `minus-circle-outline` | `#9E9E9E` |

---

## Database Schema (SQLite)

```sql
teams(id, name, short_name, admin_pin_hash, latitude, longitude, created_at, updated_at)
players(id, team_id, name, batting_style, bowling_style, is_wicket_keeper, is_all_rounder,
        is_captain, is_vice_captain)
matches(id, format, config_json, status, team1_id, team2_id, team1_playing_xi,
        team2_playing_xi, toss_json, venue, match_date, result, match_state_json,
        created_at, updated_at)
user_prefs(key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT)
leagues(id, name, short_name, team_ids TEXT, format TEXT DEFAULT 'round_robin', created_at, updated_at)
league_fixtures(id, league_id, team1_id, team2_id, match_id, venue, scheduled_date,
                status, result, team1_score, team2_score, winner_team_id,
                nrr_data_json TEXT, round INTEGER, bracket_slot INTEGER, created_at, updated_at)
```

Migrations: `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` in try/catch. **Never `NOT NULL` in migrations** — breaks Android SQLite < 3.37.

## Supabase Schema (Cloud)
Run `supabase-setup.sql` in the SQL Editor (idempotent — safe to re-run).
Tables: `cloud_teams`, `cloud_players`, `delegate_codes`, `chat_messages`, `live_matches`, `user_profiles`, `cloud_leagues`, `cloud_league_fixtures`.
Credentials go in `.env` as `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.

`user_profiles` stores phone, name, pinHash, role. PIN verification goes through `verify_user_profile()` RPC (SECURITY DEFINER) — the hash is never returned to clients. The RPC uses pgcrypto (`crypt`, `gen_salt`) and requires `SET search_path = public, extensions` because Supabase installs pgcrypto in the `extensions` schema.

`cloud_leagues` / `cloud_league_fixtures` are owner-scoped (`owner_phone` column). `league-store` pushes on every mutation and pulls on `loadLeagues` when authenticated.

Supported key formats: legacy JWT (`length > 100`) **or** new publishable format (`sb_publishable_` prefix). Both are accepted — validation is in `src/config/supabase.ts`.

`live_matches` is upserted on every ball (and undo, start innings, declare). If any table doesn't exist yet, `PGRST205` errors are silently ignored so the app degrades gracefully.

## Shared Utilities & Components

- `src/utils/player-icons.ts` — `bowlingIcon(style)` and `battingIcon(style)` — use these instead of local icon lookups in UI files
- `src/utils/avatar.ts` — `getAvatarColor(name)` and `AVATAR_COLORS` constant — use for team/player avatar backgrounds
- `src/utils/formatters.ts` — `formatOvers(overs, balls)` (e.g. `"3.2"`) and other display formatters — import from here, do not redefine locally
- `src/components/NearbyLiveCard.tsx` — shared card for nearby live match display (used by home tab + guest screen). Also exports `LIVE_RED = '#D32F2F'` — use this constant anywhere live/in-progress status needs a red color instead of hardcoding the hex.

---

## EAS Build (Play Store / App Store)

`eas.json` defines two profiles:
- `preview` → APK (`android.buildType: "apk"`) — for direct device install / testing
- `production` → AAB (`android.buildType: "app-bundle"`) — for Play Store submission

`.npmrc` sets `legacy-peer-deps=true` (required — EAS npm install fails without it).
`.easignore` excludes `scripts/` from the build tarball (avoids `sharp` native binary errors).

```bash
eas build --profile preview --platform android    # Build APK
eas build --profile production --platform android # Build AAB
```

Android package: `com.gullycricket.scorer` · versionCode: bump in `app.json` before each store upload.

## Things to Avoid

- **Do not** call repo functions directly from UI — always go through the store
- **Do not** use `Alert.alert` with multiple buttons — use Paper `Dialog`
- **Do not** hardcode text colors — use MD3 theme tokens
- **Do not** let `matchRepo.createMatch()` generate its own UUID — pass the client ID
- **Do not** add `NOT NULL` in `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` migrations
- **Do not** import React or RN APIs into `src/engine/`
- **Do not** use `npm install` for Expo packages — use `npx expo install`
- **Do not** put PRAGMAs and CREATE TABLE in the same `execAsync` call (Android bug)
